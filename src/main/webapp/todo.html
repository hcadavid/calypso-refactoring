                Would it be possible to have an output table for GroupPlots RankTest (BoxPlot), since this is the only stats analysis showing the results by pairs? That would be really really really really really really nice.

ð  Don’t you get this information from the “Stats” tab? Or maybe I misunderstand your question.

 

 

Would it be possible to have a filter based on the p-value for Network

ð  Would be useful, I’ll add it to my list

Would it be possible to have the TA Type: Stripchart with the median +  interquartile instead of the mean + SD?
