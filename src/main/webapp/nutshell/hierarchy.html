 <h3>In a nutshell</h3 >

<ol>
    <li>Select the level of interest (e.g. Genus)
    <li>Select tree type (e.g. Dendrogram, radial tree, or Krona plot) or correlation network
    <li>Select the edge with (e.g. all wedges with the same weight or according to the relative abundance of the node in all samples)
       Select if you want to see the distribution of read in the groups (either groupP or groupS)
    <li>Correlations between taxa/OTUs are represented as edges between nodes. Nodes can be coloured according to higher taxonomic ranks. Positive correlations (Pearson-correlation) are displayed in yellow, negative correlations in blue. The minimal required correlation that is displayed as edge can be adjusted by setting Edge Min Similarity. 
    <li>Press Draw Chart
    <li>In radial tree: Click on the node to get a barplot visualization of the read distribution (if "Sampleplots" is checked)
    <li>In correlation network: Drag and drop the nodes.
    <li>Krona: Click on the link which will open a new window with the Krona graph. 
    <li>Press download to view the image in svg format in a new window.
