 <h3>In a nutshell</h3 >
<ol>
         <li>Select rank (e.g. Genus) and press "Select Mode" and "Draw Chart" 
             to visualize the correlation between
             different bacterial groups as network. Taxa and factors are 
             depicted as nodes, correlations as edges. Positive correlations (Pearson-correlation) 
             are displayed in yellow,
             negative correlations in blue. The minimal required
             correlation that is represented as edge can be adjusted by setting Edge Min Similarity.
