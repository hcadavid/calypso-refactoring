 <h3>In a nutshell</h3 >

This page provides a statistical comparison of paired data 
(e.g. by paired t-test or paired rank test). 
    For example, paired tests can be used to study the affects of drug treatment 
    on the composition of the gut microbiota, e.g. to compare the community composition of 
    each subject
    before and after treatment. In this example, the samples taken from the same subject
    (before and after treatment) are paired. Only those individuals for which samples at 
    both selected time points/locations are present are included.

<ol>
         <li>Select rank (e.g. Family) 
         <li>Set Type to DiversityScatter to compare the community diversity at T1 and T2 as
             scatter plot. Press Draw Chart.</li>
         <li>Press "Select Mode"
         <li>Choose time points or locations that should be compared, make sure that
             G1 and G2 are different.</li>
        
         <li> Set Type to BubblePlot to compare the abundance of different bacterial groups
             at T1 and T2. The size of the rectangles indicate the difference in abundance
             when comparing T1 to T2. Press Draw Chart.</li>
         <li>Set Type to TaxaScatter to compare the  abundance of one taxon/OTU at
             T1 and T2. Use the Taxon drop-down menu to select the taxon/OTU to be compared.
             Press Draw Chart.</li>
             <li>Set Type to Table and press Draw Chart to do a paired statistical
                 comparison (using paired Wilcoxon rank test or paired t-Test). Click on P in
                 the displayed table to order the taxa/OTUs by P-value.</li>
