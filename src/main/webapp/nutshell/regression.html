 <h3>In a nutshell</h3 >

<ol>
        <li>Select a rank (e.g. Genus), set "Regress by" to "Taxa vs Envp" and press "Set Mode",
            followed by "Run Analysis". The displayed table shows the effect of the environmental
            variables on the abundance of taxa. For each taxon a regression model is fit
            of the form:<br/>abundance of taxon = env1 + env2 + env3 ...,<br/>where env1, env2, ... are
            the environmental variables. For each taxon and each
            environmental variable a p-value is shown, indicating if the variable impacts
            the abundance of the respective taxon. Select an environmental variable in the header of the displayed
            table to sort the p-values. If you have paired data, select the "Paired" checkbox
            and press "Run Analysis". In the case of paired data, a linear mixed effects
            model is fit of the form: 
            <br/> abundance of taxon = env1 + env2 + env3 ... + pair1 + pair2 + ...,<br/>
            where the environmental variables are included as fixed effects and the pairs as
            random effect.
        </li>
         <li>Use the Taxa drop-down menu to select a specific taxon or OTU. Press "Run Analysis"
             to analyze the correlation between the abundance of the selected taxon/OTU and the
             environmental variables.
         <li>Next, do a regression analysis to identify complex associations between
             environmental variables and the community diversity. First, set Taxa to "All" and
             "Regress by" to "Diversity vs Envp" and press "Set Mode". Next set the Index
             to either "Shannon" or "Richness" and press "Run Analysis". In the
             generated figure, first the p-values of the
             regression model are displayed. Additionally,
             for each environmental variable a two scatter-plots are shown. The p-values dispalyed
             in the scatter plot indicate if the Pearson correlation between the environmental
             variable and the diversity index is significant. Select the "Paired" checkbox for
             paired data.
         </li>
         <li>You can further do a regression analysis to identify environmental variables
             impacting the global community composition. Set "Regress by" to "Distance vs Envp"
             and press "Set Mode". Next, set Taxa to "All", "Distance Method"
             to "Jaccard" and press "Run Analysis".
         </li>
         <li>Calculate multiple linear regression model to explain the grouping of samples
             as specified in the meta data file.
             Set "Regress by" to Group and press "Set Mode". Select different groups for
             condition A and condition B. Set Taxa to "All". Press "Run Analysis".
