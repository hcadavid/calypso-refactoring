        <li>Select a
        rank (e.g. genus or OTU) and press "Draw Chart".</li>
        <li>To obtain high-quality figures, adjust the image resolution, width and height.</li>
        <li>Increasing curves indicate an under-sampling, i.e. that not all bacterial groups of
            the underlying community are represented by the sequence data.
            Reads are randomly selected from each sample and the number of present
            taxa/OTUs counted. Mean species richness is the number of taxa/OTUs observed for a
            given sample size.
