<ol>
        <li>Select your
        rank of interest (e.g. Family)</li>
        <li>Select a statistical test and press "Select Mode"</li>
        <li>Press "Do Stats"</li>
        <li>Click on "P" in the table to sort the bacterial groups by p-value.</li>
        <li>The p-value distribution (histogram)
        on the left side of the figure indicates if low (significant) p-values are relevant
        or observed poorly by chance. A uniform p-value distribution indicates that low
        p-values were observed by chance. The uniform (expected) p-value distribution is
        indicated by the red line "Expected". An increase of low p-values (a negative binominal
        distribution with small r) indicates that low
        p-values are relevant (significant) and that the compared groups are different.
