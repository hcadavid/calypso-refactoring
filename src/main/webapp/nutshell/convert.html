    <li>Select the format of your file, choose your file, press Convert and save the converted
        file locally on your computer by clicking with the right mouse button on "Converted File"

    <li>To convert QIIME files, first convert the QIIME mapping file. Set format to
        "QIIME Mapping", choose the mapping file, press Convert and save the file locally on
        your computer. Then, convert the QIIME taxonomic assignments (obtained by
        assign_taxonomy.pl) to the Calypso format. Finally, convert the OTU table.
    <li>Open/import the converted Calypso meta data file in Excel and set the
        group, individual, sample time/location of each sample. For example, if the
        samples were taken from obese and lean mice, the groups would be "lean" and "obese",
        the individuals would be the names/ids of each animal. Sample time or location could
        for example be "T1, T2, caecum, large intestine, small intestine, feces". Save the
        file in comma separated format. Open the saved file in notepad or Wordpad to control
        the file format.
